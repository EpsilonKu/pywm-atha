* LibreOffice
    -> Calc: drag to autofill
    -> Change cursor

* GIMP (XWayland)
    -> Second context menus misplaced -> children of wm_view_xwayland_child
    -> Drag color -> breaks
    -> In general pretty much unusable

* Firefox, Chromium (XWayland)
    -> Weird behaviour when "Save as" dialog is too large, can only clikc "Cancel" not "Save"

* XWayland
    -> Detect modals as child-views (analogously to child-toplevels)

* General
    -> Random key-repeats? Have to Ctrl-C to be able to input again
