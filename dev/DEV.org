#+TITLE: pywm developer information

* Development
** Current (v0.3)
*** Bugs
**** TODO Horizontal damage artifacts after closing views
**** WAIT Lag in fullscreen video on chrome

*** Performance topics
   - Goal: Idle CPU low - comparable between sway and pywm-fullscreen
   - Issue: newm - pyevdev gestures uses a lot of CPU and spawns lots of threads
   - Issue: newm - permanent top bar uses a lot of CPU
**** STRT Feedback loop wm_callback_update is too slow
   - Goal: No dropped frames in pywm animations or gestures
   - Issue: (Probably) callbacks occassionally take a long time - dropped frames
   - Issue: C-Side of view update loop takes a long time (comparable to python) - simplify using constant damage mode?
   - Issue: Focus view animations (Mod-hjkl) seem to be slower than e.g. fullscreen or overview
   - Issue: Looks like frames are dropped when keeping enter pressed in a terminal
   - Issue: Do we really need two separate framebuffers (or is one seconadary buffer to read from enough?)
   - Issue: Frame drops don't happen in direct or passthrough render modes, only in indirect (reproduce by triggering animation that does not damage - therefore full layout damaging at every frame, too slow)
**** TODO Test cases and comparison

*** STRT Better renderer
**** TODO Extensively test DEBUG_DAMAGE, different render modes, switching between render modes, frame damage optimization, damaging and blur + build test cases (e.g. damage behind blur by FocusBorder)
**** TODO Performance comparison of renderers / of blur

*** TODO wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 (in order to use wdisplays)
*** TODO Documentation
    - Gestures removed
    - pywm-fullscreen

** Backlog / Ideas
*** Secondary buffer for blurring should extend beyond primary buffer (however this is very complicated, intervenes with workspace logic, for little reward)
*** If performance-critical: Store wm_composite as texture, better damage handling
*** Enable keyboard-exclusive client (e.g. layer shell keyboard_interactivity / use in lock screen)
*** Complete libinput device config / support for external mouse
*** Use libseat from python / patched python evdev
*** Support newm-sidecar (or similar, via ws://) as touchpad
*** Touch input from yoga or similar


* Notes
** Screen record: wf-recorder
** Screen shot: grim -g "$(slurp)"
** Firefox: MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
** Chromium: --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
** Matplotlib / Qt5 on Wayland requires DISPLAY=":0" to be set
** Apple Trackpad
