#+TITLE: pywm developer information

* Development
** Current (v0.3)
*** Bugs
**** TODO Shader padding does not work together with transforms - wm_renderer api should expose second wlr_box instead of four paddings

*** STRT Better renderer
**** DONE Use frame damage instead of buffer damage while rendering to FBO - slight optimization
**** DONE Properly align Kawase shaders - results are quite poor at the moment
**** STRT Enable runtime switching between wlr_renderer, wm_renderer (with FBO and blur), wm_renderer (without FBO and blur)
**** STRT Set up wm_composite: Goal - Damaging a window behind blur requires also damaging a region around it
**** TODO Extensively test DEBUG_DAMAGE, different render modes, switching between render modes, frame buffer optimization

*** TODO Profiling, optimize CPU usage (Focus: pywm-fullscreen vs sway)
*** TODO wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 (in order to use wdisplays)
*** TODO Documentation
    - Gestures removed
    - pywm-fullscreen

** Backlog / Ideas
*** Enable keyboard-exclusive client (e.g. layer shell keyboard_interactivity / use in lock screen)
*** Complete libinput device config / support for external mouse
*** Use libseat from python / patched python evdev
*** Are separate lock shaders necessary? (It's only a performance thing)
*** Support newm-sidecar (or similar, via ws://) as touchpad
*** Touch input from yoga or similar

** Firefox: MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
** Chromium: --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
** Matplotlib / Qt5 on Wayland requires DISPLAY=":0" to be set
