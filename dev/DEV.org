#+TITLE: pywm developer information

* Development
** Current (v0.3)
*** Bugs
**** TODO Lag in fullscreen video on chrome
**** TODO Horizontal damage artifacts after closing views
**** DONE Gestures break up on secondary monitor
**** TODO After gestures -> broken blur
**** TODO FocusBorder on secondary monitor
**** DONE Respect workspace in blur and ensure newm sets it properly (multiple screens issue)

*** STRT Performance topics
   - Goal: Idle CPU low - comparable between sway and pywm-fullscreen
   - Goal: No dropped frames in pywm animations or gestures
   - Issue: newm - pyevdev gestures uses a lot of CPU and spawns lots of threads
   - Issue: newm - permanent top bar uses a lot of CPU
   - Issue: Callbacks occassionally take a long time - dropped frames
   - Issue: wm_config.callback_frequency low means gestures start jumpy and animations start late; high uses a lot of CPU (as long as callbacks are inefficient)
   - Issue: Are there slow animation frames (Python message), where there is no issue with too slow callbacks (i.e. other non-performance-related)
   - Example: Open alacritty, hit Mod - slow animations. Open alacritty, start "tail -f newm_log" (i.e. client-side damaging), hit Mod - fast animations (low wm_config.callback_frequency)

*** TODO Test cases and comparison

*** STRT Better renderer
**** TODO Extensively test DEBUG_DAMAGE, different render modes, switching between render modes, frame damage optimization, damaging and blur + build test cases (e.g. damage behind blur by FocusBorder)
**** TODO Performance comparison of renderers / of blur

*** TODO wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 (in order to use wdisplays)
*** TODO Documentation
    - Gestures removed
    - pywm-fullscreen

** Backlog / Ideas
*** If performance-critical: Store wm_composite as texture, better damage handling
*** Enable keyboard-exclusive client (e.g. layer shell keyboard_interactivity / use in lock screen)
*** Complete libinput device config / support for external mouse
*** Use libseat from python / patched python evdev
*** Support newm-sidecar (or similar, via ws://) as touchpad
*** Touch input from yoga or similar


* Notes
** Screen record: wf-recorder
** Screen shot: grim -g "$(slurp)"
** Firefox: MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
** Chromium: --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
** Matplotlib / Qt5 on Wayland requires DISPLAY=":0" to be set
** Apple Trackpad
