#+TITLE: pywm developer information

* Development
** Current (v0.3)
*** TODO Change requirements.txt to only include stubs
*** DONE wlroots migration to gitlab.freedesktop.org

*** Optimization / Improvements
**** TODO Try some optimizations of update loop if no state (view nor layout nor widget) changes (most common case) --> bring down idle CPU / Maybe store callable view._update directly in _pywm_view (remove look-ups) / Investigate scaling of idle cpu with number of views
**** TODO Layer shell: Keyboard interactivity

*** Decorations
**** DONE Pass decoration per view to python
**** STRT Provide a range of widgets to be used as decoration / highlight / ...
- [X] Enable custom shaders to draw primitives (without textures) in wm_renderer
- [X] Possible to also simplify existing shader handling?
- [X] Shaders for rect and rounded corner rect
- [X] Replace shader.c by shader.glsl
- [X] Reenable flag WM_CUSTOM_RENDERER
- [ ] Generate number of shaders / move to malloc
- [ ] Are separate lock-shaders necessary? (It's only a performance thing)
- [X] wm_config for shader to be used for views
- [X] Configure (down_state) wm_widgets to represent certain primitives

*** Gestures
**** TODO Can c gestures make python gestures redundant? (Maybe enable switching) - would cure libseat+pyevdev issues
**** TODO Configurable gestures (abstraction layer) + possibility to use external "gesture providers" (e.g. detection from webcam video)

** Backlog / Ideas
*** wlr_output_manager
*** Complete libinput device config / support for external mouse
*** Use libseat from python / patched python evdev
*** Support newm-sidecar (or similar, via ws://) as touchpad
*** Touch input from yoga or similar
