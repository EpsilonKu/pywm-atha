#+TITLE: pywm developer information

* Development
** Current

*** Multiple outputs
- [X] Accept config per output
- [ ] wlr_surface_send_enter
- [X] Config per output from Python
- [ ] Report detailed layout to python
- [ ] Get rid of pywm.output_scale
- [ ] Is pywm.round_scale necessary? Issues if set to 1 (write test cases)? Probably only sensible to scale according to logical pixels (round_scale == output_scale)
- [ ] Fix widgets to one output
- [ ] Render windows / widgets / mouse according to layout
- [ ] Possibility to duplicate screen? or at least place windows (widgets also?) on multiple screens at the same time
*** Output transforms
*** Complete libinput device config / support for external mouse

*** Touch input from yoga or similar
*** Screensharing using xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
*** Decorations for floating windows (dialogs)
