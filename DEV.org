#+TITLE: pywm developer information

* Development
** Current
*** STRT Update and check TESTS.org
*** TODO Damaging bugs on firefox start

** v0.2
*** Enable wayvnc.sh
- [ ] virtual_pointer and virtual_keyboard
*** Output transforms
*** Multiple outputs
- [ ] Accept config per output
- [ ] Report detailed layout
- [ ] Fix widgets to one output
- [ ] Render windows / widgets / mouse according to layout
- [ ] Is round_scale necessary? Issues if set to 1 (write test cases)? Probably only sensible to scale according to logical pixels (round_scale == output_scale)
- [ ] Possibility to duplicate screen? or at leaast place windows (widgets also?) on multiple screens at the same time
*** Complete libinput device config / support for external mouse

** Backlog / Ideas
*** Screensharing using xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
*** Decorations for floating windows (dialogs)

- GDK on XWayland: GDK_DPI_SCALE=2
- Electron apps: --force-device-scale-factor=2

- Screen record: wf-recorder
- Screen shot: grim
- Firefox: MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
- Chromium: --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
- Matplotlib / Qt5 on Wayland requires DISPLAY=":0" to be set
