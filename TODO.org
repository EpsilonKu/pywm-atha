* Current (aiming for v0.1.0)

** Bugs
*** STRT Chromium bug 1: Initially sized too small (scaled correctly) - possibly related to set_tiled
*** STRT Chromium bug 2: Size update -> buffers are not used fully / weird scaling - possibly Chromium needs an additional trigger to render correctly (as opposed to every single other app)

** Documentation
*** STRT Update and check TESTS.org

* Backlog / Ideas
** Multiple outputs
** Inline comments "TODO"
** Screensharing using xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
** Decorations for floating windows (dialogs)
