* termite, gnome-mpv, gnome-calculator
    -> No apparent issues

* GIMP (XWayland)
    -> Appears to be usable, however, not checked in detail

* LibreOffice
    -> Subsurface tooltips accept input which kills drag-to-autofill (calc) when hovering over
        tooltips. IMHO that's a LibreOffice issue

* Firefox, Chromium (XWayland)
    -> Usable
    -> Weird behaviour when "Save as" dialog is too large, can only clikc "Cancel" not "Save"
    -> Mouse clicks missing in fullscreen YT, seems to be related to scaling

* IntelliJ
    -> Usable


------- TODO -------

* XWayland
    -> Check that it works: Detect modals as child-views (analogously to child-toplevels)
    -> Views are allowed to configure in any way they want (-> lots of overlapping modals and similar shit)

* General
    -> Views change their minimal width/height after initial set; this is ignored leading to ugly scaling
    -> Cursor not displayed initially (Open termite, fullscreen, open chromium, move cursor.. nothing there)
